<h2>Welcome to FWTI</h2>
<p>
    Welcome to the Free Worlds Technical Institute (FWTI). Since Captain-General Janos Marik signed the
    law establishing our institution in 3023, we have been the premier educational research
    facility in the Free Worlds League. In our first decade, we helped to understand and
    distribute the Star League technologies contained in the Helm memory core, and since those
    early years, we have continued to work closely with the FWLM and industrial partners such as
    Diverse Optics, Earthwerks-FWL, and Irian Technologies to push forward the boundaries of
    physics, engineering, chemistry, and other applied fields.
